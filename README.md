# Freelancing Skill Suggester - Final Project at Code in Place 2024

A simple python program that suggests freelancing skills based on the user's passion.

## Description
This is my final project for the special online course Code in Place 2024 by Stanford University. This python program uses core concepts from Code in Place's course lectures such as variables, lists, dictionaries, loops, and random library. The user can select a passion category and the number of skills they want to suggest, and the program will randomly select a set of skills from a predefined dictionary and display them to the user.

## Goal of the Project
The goal of this project is to provide users with a personalized list of skills that they might be interested in learning or exploring further.
